## Introducing **HULK-v3** :robot:

| :information_source: | **Hulk** is a *Distributed Denial of Service* tool that can put heavy load on HTTPS servers, in order to bring them to their knees, by exhausting the resource pool. |

You can refer the Changelog [here](/CHANGELOG.md).


<details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"><h2>Usage :book:</h2></summary>

1.  Run `pip install -r requirements_(linux/win).txt` before starting this script.
    > Ex: On Windows: `pip install -r requirements_win.txt`
    > Ex: On Linux: `pip install -r requirements_linux.txt`

2.  Launch the `hulk_launcher.py server` with the target website as arg.
    > Ex: `python hulk_launcher.py server https://testdummysite.com`
    >
    > Append `--persistent False` to kill the botnet after a succesfull DDoS.
    >
    > Append `--gui` if you are running the GUI in parallel.

3.  Launch the `hulk_launcher.py client` to spawn multiple processes of hulk - one per CPU Core.
    > Ex: `python hulk_launcher.py client [localhost]`
    >
    > If the server is running remotely, replace localhost with the server's IP.

4. To run the GUI, you need to:
    * Install `NodeJS`, change to `gui` directory and use `npm install`.
    * Launch the GUI with `npm run dev`.

5.  Sit back and sip your coffee while the carnage unleashes! üòà

*(P.S. Do not run the binaries (except `hulk_gui`) directly, use them from command line like shown above without using `python`.)*

<details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"><h2>Architecture :gear:</h2></summary>

| :warning: The intention of Hulk is to demonstrate the damage that a DDoS attack can do to a server if unprotected. |
| :--- |
| :bulb: Please go through the code for full details. I'm keeping it well documented and request the contributors to do so too. |

Hulk consists of 2 major and 1 optional components:
 - Server
 - Client
 - [Gui]

<p align="center">

 ![Hulk_architecture](/assets/Hulk_architecture.svg)

</p>

**Client :space_invader:**

> The core part of Hulk is the `Hulk client` aka `Hulk.py`. \
This client\bot launches a barrage of `asynchronous HTTP requests` to the target server. \
These incoming requests, put a burden on the target and makes it slow to respond. \
With the launcher script, we can launch multiple instances of Hulk using `multi-threading`. \
The target will be hit with so many requests that it will ultimately break into a `500 error`. \
Usually, the client completes 500 attacks and sends back the list of status messages. \
In case of special events, the client will immediately send an Interrupt message to the server. \
Example Special Events: *Successful DDoS*, *404 Target Not Found*, etc.

**Server :computer:**

> Hulk was originally a single instanced DoS script. However, it has been modified to be run as multiple instances. \
The cluster of many such instances is called a `botnet`. And this botnet can be controlled and monitored by the `Server`. \
The `Server` and `Client` communicate with each other through TCP `WebSockets`.
Based on the settings, this is usally a persistent bidirectional channel. \
In case the server receives `Interrupts` from a client, it will send out a broadcast message to all the clients, asking them to stop the attacks. \
The clients go to Standby mode and await further instructions from the server.
>
> The server can also send information to the GUI to keep a track of the botnet. \
This information is sent via Unix\Windows `Named Pipes` for low latency `IPC`.

**GUI :desktop_computer:**

> The GUI is a `NextJS` web application that is used to monitor the botnet via Named Pipes. \
When run as a binary, GUI makes use of `Electron` which exposes the information directly to the Frontend. \
When run as a Node process, a node server listens to the Named Pipe and passes on the information to a HTTP Streaming API. \
Then the frontend will pick it up from the API using `EventSource`.
